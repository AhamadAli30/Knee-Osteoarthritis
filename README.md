# Knee-Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a degenerative joint disease leading to the gradual loss of cartilage, which cushions bones in the knee joint. This wear causes bones to rub together, resulting in pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. Knee OA is common with age and is influenced by wear and tear, obesity, injury, and genetics.
